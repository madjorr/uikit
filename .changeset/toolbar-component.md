Add `Toolbar`: a horizontal action row — list actions, an optional overflow
control, and an optional trailing area (a status text, or a selection
counter + action) — for use above/below a list or table when rows are
selected or bulk actions are available.

- `disabled` cascades to every nested Button/ButtonMenu via a native
  `<fieldset disabled>` — no prop-drilling into arbitrary children.
- `ToolbarActionList` renders an `actions` array as ghost Buttons and
  auto-collapses the trailing ones into a "More actions" `ButtonMenu` +
  `DropdownMenu` once they no longer fit the row, re-measuring on resize. The
  row is a single Tab stop, with arrow-key roving-tabindex between visible
  actions and the overflow trigger, via Base UI's `Toolbar.Root`/
  `Toolbar.Button` (`@base-ui/react/toolbar`) — matching the WAI-ARIA toolbar
  pattern.
- `ToolbarActions` is a right-aligned trailing slot (8px gap) that grows to
  fill leftover row space without shrinking below its own content's natural
  width, so its text never wraps or overlaps the action row.
- No dedicated token tier — every action brings its own tokens; the 16px/8px
  gaps are un-tokenized, same precedent as `FilterSearch`.
