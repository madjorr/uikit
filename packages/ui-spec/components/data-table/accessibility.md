# DataTable — accessibility

- Renders a real `<table>` via the Table primitives, so column headers and cells
  carry native table semantics for assistive tech.
- The sort control is a real `<button>` that toggles the sort on a single click
  (and Enter/Space); it carries an `aria-label` ("Sort by <title>") and the sort
  direction is conveyed by the arrow icon alongside the always-rendered text title.
- Pagination controls are icon buttons with explicit labels ("Go to next page",
  etc.); the rows-per-page control is a labelled select.
- Selection checkboxes need an `aria-label` ("Select row" / "Select all") since
  they have no visible label in the cell.
- The view-options menu is keyboard-navigable (Base UI menu).
- `DataTableExpandTrigger` is a real `<button>` carrying `aria-expanded` and an
  "Expand row" / "Collapse row" label; it renders nothing for a row that can't
  expand.
- The column resize handle is a `role="separator"` with `aria-orientation`
  vertical and an "Resize column" label (override via `resizeColumnLabel`)
  (`enableColumnResizing`). A **group-parent header cell** (one that spans its
  leaf columns in a grouped header) deliberately renders no handle: it covers
  more than one column, so there is no single column boundary for the separator
  to describe or for arrow keys to move. Resizing stays on the leaf headers,
  where each handle maps to exactly one column.
- **Row navigation uses a roving tabindex**: exactly one data row is a Tab stop
  (`tabIndex={0}`, the rest `-1`), and Arrow Up / Arrow Down move both DOM focus
  and which row that is. Focusing a row by click syncs the roving index too,
  so the last-interacted row stays the Tab stop. The index is clamped against the
  live row count, so filtering or paging to fewer rows can't leave it pointing
  past the end.
- The trailing action column's controls are labelled buttons: the header's
  column-visibility cog (`columnSettingsLabel`) and each row's overflow-actions
  ellipsis (`rowActionsLabel`), both overridable to localize.
- Each header cell's capability hint is a `Tooltip` on the cell itself, so it is
  announced on keyboard focus as well as hover; a column with no capability
  renders no tooltip.
- Per-column filter fields live in a keyboard-navigable `FilterSearchFilters`
  popover; each applied-filter chip below the toolbar removes its own filter.
- The infinite-scroll loading row (`paginationMode="infinite"`, `isLoadingMore`)
  carries `role="status"`/`aria-live="polite"` with an `sr-only` "Loading more
  rows…" text, so a screen-reader user is told a fetch is in flight without
  having to notice the animated placeholder.

## Known limitations

- **Column reordering (`enableColumnReordering`) is pointer-only.** It is native
  HTML5 drag-and-drop on the header cells, with no keyboard equivalent — a
  keyboard-only user cannot reorder columns. Resizing (arrow keys on the handle)
  and sorting (Enter/Space on the header button) are unaffected, and the reorder
  hint in the header tooltip describes a gesture only a pointer user can perform.
  Recorded here deliberately: closing the gap needs a designed keyboard model
  (e.g. a move-mode toggle plus arrow-key steps), not a spot fix.

## Contrast

DataTable composes already-themed components; their tokens meet contrast in light
and dark. The wrapper border (`--ui-border-on-surface-border`) and muted
empty-state / pagination text (`--ui-text-on-surface-secondary`) meet the
relevant contrast over the page surface.
